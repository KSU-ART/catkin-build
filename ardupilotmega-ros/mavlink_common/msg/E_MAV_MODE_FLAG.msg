# ENUM: E_MAV_MODE_FLAG
# Description:These flags encode the MAV mode.
# 0b10000000 MAV safety set to armed. Motors are enabled / running / can start. Ready to fly.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_SAFETY_ARMED = 128
# 0b01000000 remote control input is enabled.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_MANUAL_INPUT_ENABLED = 64
# 0b00100000 hardware in the loop simulation. All motors / actuators are blocked, but internal software is full operational.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_HIL_ENABLED = 32
# 0b00010000 system stabilizes electronically its attitude (and optionally position). It needs however further control inputs to move around.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_STABILIZE_ENABLED = 16
# 0b00001000 guided mode enabled, system flies MISSIONs / mission items.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_GUIDED_ENABLED = 8
# 0b00000100 autonomous mode enabled, system finds its own goal positions. Guided flag can be set or not, depends on the actual implementation.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_AUTO_ENABLED = 4
# 0b00000010 system has a test mode enabled. This flag is intended for temporary system tests and should not be used for stable implementations.
uint8 E_MAV_MODE_FLAG_TEST_ENABLED = 2
# 0b00000001 Reserved for future use.
