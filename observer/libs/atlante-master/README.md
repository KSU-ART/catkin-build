Atlante
=======
Atlante is a cross-platform (Linux/Windows) library for:
- Linear algebra
- Multi-threading
- High resolution timers
- String manipulation

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: I have recently added some thread synchronization functionalities that only work on Linux. So, if you are developing on Windows, please handle with care.

Installation
============
On Linux:
Run 'sudo make install'

On Windows:
- If you are using GNU Make, run 'gmake' and copy lib/gcc/libatlante.a to some folder in your library path.
- If you are using Visual Studio, there is a 'Visual Studio' subfolder under 'IDEs'.
